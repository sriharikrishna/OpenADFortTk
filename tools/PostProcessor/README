This is version 0 of the python OpenAD postprocessor.

It does NOT do inlining or template expansion

invoke it by:

   python pp.v0.py FILENAME.f

it will output (into the same directory), the post processed file
that is named FILENAME.pp.f

You should also run the unit tests:

    cd PyLib/UnitTests
    ./runem.sh >& tests.out

Technical Notes:
===============
A Lib directory is supplied, but not used. PyLib is the new stuff.

Version 0 uses a simple list of statements program representation.
Final version will use a list of units representation. Furthermore,
a unit will have a subcomponent that is also a list of units (to cover
the 'contains' element of F90).
