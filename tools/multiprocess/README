To use the preprocessor, you *must* define 2 files:

   ad_inline.f
   ad_template.f

When you run the preprocessor, you *must* have these 2 specific
files in the directory where you run the pipeline. 

Sample files are supplied in the Samples Directory.

Known limitations:

   The indentation sucks.

   No error checking (doubly defined definitions, missing
   template directives, etc will all cause massive failure)
